Assembler and simulator for the 6809.

I wrote an assembler and a simulator for the Motorola M6809 processor.

The first file of this shell archive contains C source, the second part
conttains example programs that can be run on the simulator.

The archive contains:
a09.c the 6809 assembler. It's fairly portable (ansi) C. It works on both
      Unix and DOS (TC2.0). 

      Features of the assembler.
      - generates binary file starting at  the first address
        where code is actually generated. So an initial block of RMB's
        (maybe at a different ORG) is not included in the file.
      - Accepts standard syntax.
      - full expression evaluator.
      - Statements SET, MACRO, PUBLIC, EXTERN IF/ELSE/ENDIF INCLUDE not yet
        implemented. Some provisions are already made internally for macros 
        and/or relocatable objects.

V09.c  the 6809 simulator. Loads a binary image (from a09) at adress $100
       and starts executing. SWI2 and SWI3 are for character output/input.
       SYNC stops simulation. When compiling set -DBIG_ENDIAN if your 
       computer is big-endian. Set TERM_CONTROL for a crude single character
       (instead of ANSI line-by-line) input. Works on Unix.
v09tc.c same for Turbo C. Has its own term control.

test09.asm and bench09.asm simple test and benchmark progs.

ef09.asm Implementation of E-Forth, a very rudimentary and portable Forth.
      Type WORDS to see what words you have. You can evaluate RPN integer
      expressions, like "12 34 + 5 * . " You can make new words like
      " : SQUARED DUP * ; " etc.
